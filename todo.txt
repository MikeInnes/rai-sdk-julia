# todo

## api.jl

* do we now have delete_user?
* should load/delete_model take multiple args? or should we have multi-arg variants?
* load_* functions should all take data as string or io

## rest.jl

* implement get_access_token_func callback

## exaples

* delete-engine.jl returns 404 when engine is gone because we are polling
  w/get-engine .. should not report that error
